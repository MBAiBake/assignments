# MBAI Assignment 8

Welcome to your 9th MBAI 410 assignment!

Please access the full instructions and specifications on canvas [here](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/151977/assignments/976490). 

Your job will be to modify the `sudoku_lib.py` as specified by the pdf and the docstrings provided in the file. The function skeleton is already provided for you, but the logic and the actual body of the body needs to be written. You will be responsible for writing four functions, i.e. `failure_test`, `goal_test`, `update`, `BFS` and `DFS`. 

The test included in the asssignment will be ran everytime you push to this github repo through GitHub Action.

If you wish to add more tests, you could modify the `sudoku_test.py` file by adding new functions containing the assertion(s) that you feel would evaluate the logic of the match function. By convention, the function name should start with `test_`. The existing test cases should not be modified, however.
