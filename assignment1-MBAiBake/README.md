# MBAI Assignment 1

Welcome to your first MBAI 410 assignment!

Please access the full instructions and specifications on canvas [here](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/151977/assignments/946418). 

The file containing the `match` function will be located in `match_lib.py`. The function skeleton is already provided for you, but the logic and the actual body of the body needs to be written.

The test included in the asssignment will be ran everytime you push to this github repo through GitHub Action.

If you wish to add more tests (which is *always* a good idea), you could modify the `match_test.py` file by adding new functions containing the assertion(s) that you feel would evaluate the logic of the match function. By convention, the function name should start with `test_`. The existing test cases should not be modified, however.
